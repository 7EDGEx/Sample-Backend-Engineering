# Backend-Engineering

Welcome to Backend Engineering Community. 

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community. To enhance the learning experience, we aim to create a meaningful community where we can share knowledge. By doing so, we can learn from others, avoiding the need to solve the same problems from scratch. This collaborative approach not only minimizes the time spent on repetitive problem-solving but also allows us to invest our time in addressing novel challenges, fostering innovation in unique and new cases.
